VueJS shares a number of concepts with AngularJS. If you have used Angular before, you will find VueJS very easy to pick up.

### View

The actual HTML that the user sees.

### Template

The HTML with additional markup.

### Model

A slightly modified plain JavaScript object.

### ViewModel

An object that syncs the Model and the View.

### Directive

A prefixed HTML attribute that tells VueJS to do something about an element.

### Filter

A function to process the value with before updating the View.

### Expression

Simple JavaScript expressions that can be used inside directives.

### Computed Property

A model property that gets auto-updated when its dependencies change.
