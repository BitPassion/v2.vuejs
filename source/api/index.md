The `Vue` Class is the core of vue.js - in fact, it is everything that vue.js offers. It is a constructor that allows you to create ViewModel instances. It can be subclassed with its `extend()` method and it also holds several other global utility methods. Creating a ViewModel instance is straightforward:

``` js
var vm = new Vue(options)
```
